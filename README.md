# Dirty Data Project

### Hello and welcome to the README page for my Dirty Data Project

#### Project Brief

The main objective of this particular project was to carryout a thorough data clean and analysis on a data set that contained the results a 'trick or treat' questionnaire.

As the title of the project suggests, the data was particularly messy, which was initially quite intimidating.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and found it extremely satisfying to start off with such a complicated data set and to be able to make sense of it.

#### The Process

The process I applied to the project was a very methodical one. Folder structure was very important for this project as it allowed me go through each stage of the project without getting myself into a mess.

#### Folder Structure

1.  Raw Data
2.  Cleaning Scripts
3. Cleaned Data
4. Analysis Report
